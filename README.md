# Score Tracker  

## Overview  
The **Score Tracker** is a web-based grading system designed to help users **input scores, calculate grades, and determine final grades dynamically**. It provides a **modern and sleek** interface where users can **add rows**, **input scores**, and **see real-time calculations** for quizzes, performance tasks, and exams.  

## Features  
âœ… **Dynamic Score Entry** â€“ Users can input their scores and items, and the system will **automatically compute the overall score**.  
âœ… **Real-Time Percentage Calculation** â€“ The system calculates the **weighted grade** for each section based on predefined percentages:  
- **Quizzes, Activities & Others:** **20% weight**  
- **Performance Task:** **30% weight**  
- **Exam:** **50% weight**  
âœ… **Final Grade Calculation** â€“ After calculating each section, the system **combines all weighted grades to generate the final grade**.  
âœ… **Add/Delete Rows** â€“ Users can **dynamically add or remove rows**, and the system will update the calculations accordingly.  
âœ… **Input Validation** â€“ Prevents users from entering **scores higher than the total items** and displays a **red error message** if invalid input is detected.  

## How It Works

2. **The system automatically calculates** the overall grade for that section.  
3. **Each sectionâ€™s weighted grade is calculated** based on its percentage.
